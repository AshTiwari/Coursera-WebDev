	<h1>Example = 1 <br> Inheritance Origin Specificity </h1>

	<ol>Rules: 
		<li> If styles are mentioned at multiple places for an element and none of it address same properties then all the properties merge without conflict.  e.g. Check Example 1</li>
		<li>Origin:  If styles are mentioned at multiple places for an element and some of it address same properties then origin is checked and last decleration wins. e.g. Check Example 2 and 3 </li>
	
		<li> Inheritance: <br>
			<a href="inheritance.html" target="_blank"   title="Inheritance">
		</li>

		<li> Specificity: Most specific selector combination wins. Priority order for specificity is 
			<ol>
			<li> style </li>
			<li> ID </li>
			<li> class, psuedo class, attribute </li>
			<li> no. of elements </li>
			The one with the higher value wins.
			</ol>	
		Check for specificity at <a href="specificity.html" target="_blank"   title="specificity">			
		</li>
	</ol>
